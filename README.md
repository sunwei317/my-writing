# How to train Yolov3 and Yolov5 with your ownÂ datasets


## Introduction



## Set up Yolov5 environment
```python
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Label images
There many object labelling tools, such as [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg), 
[CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat) 
and [VoTT](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT). Here we will use VoTT to label our images.
Note [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) is easy to use if you only label one class 
of objects.
